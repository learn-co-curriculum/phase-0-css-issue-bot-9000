# CSS Validation Lab: Issue Bot 9000

## Learning Goals

- Change invalid CSS to valid CSS

## Introduction

Although today's browsers are becoming more capable of handing errors in CSS,
some errors are not always caught gracefully. This variable can make it
extremely difficult to apply style or layout consistently. What can be done to
quickly scan our CSS documents for issues? Let's practice using the W3C's CSS
Validator!

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code. Run `learn test` to as you go to see your test progress.

## Change Invalid CSS to Valid CSS

In this lesson, we will be taking the invalid CSS in `css/style.css` and
changing it to valid.

1. Open index.html in your browser. Notice how our styles don't look quite
   right?
2. Open css/style.css in your text editor.
3. Visit the W3C CSS validator
   [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
   If not already selected, click on the tab labeled "By direct input".
4. Copy the code from css/style.css and paste it into the text area. Click the
   "Check" button.
5. Use the error messages to correct the CSS.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until your readout states "Congratulations! No Error
   Found.".

Remember to check your progress in `index.html` in your browser!

## Conclusion

With a CSS validator, you can work your way through cleaning up errors in a CSS
document and reduce the likelihood of display errors across platforms. Using the
W3C CSS validator will help you quickly and efficiently troubleshoot your CSS.
